# Rom-Pack-Sorter
This is the old version of Rom Sorter, made in the WinForms framework. It will probably never be updated again, but fear not! The new and improved WPF version can be found [here](https://github.com/Abbin44/Rom-Sorter)

Look no more! Here is a program to automatically remove all roms that are locked to other regions than yours. This is especially handy when downloading rom-packs with various regions and consoles.
